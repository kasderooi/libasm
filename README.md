# libasm

This project is an introduction into the assembly language.

## Project description

The minimal requirements where to make a couple of simple functions like write and strlen in assembly.
I added some extra functions which, I found, forced me to go a little bit deeper into the matter like ft_putnbr and ft_split.

## How to use
> Execute the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kasderooi/libasm.git
cd libasm
make
```

> add libasm.a to your compile command line to use the functions in your program
